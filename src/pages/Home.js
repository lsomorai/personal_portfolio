          <p>
            ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Lucien!  
            Iâ€™m currently a masterâ€™s student in software engineering at the University of Calgary, graduating this April.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m passionate about building efficient, user-friendly systems, whether itâ€™s crafting intuitive frontends, 
            developing robust backends, or tackling full-stack challenges. Iâ€™m especially drawn to machine learning and AI, 
            exploring how they can solve complex problems and create smarter solutions. Topics like natural language processing, computer vision, 
            reinforcement learning, and AI-driven decision-making fascinate me. (Still learning, but thatâ€™s the fun part, right?)
          </p>
          <p>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me hitting shuttles on the badminton court, stepping to the rhythm on Pump It Up, 
            or exploring creative ways to grow both personally and professionally. Iâ€™m also a Toastmasters member working on sharpening my 
            communication skillsâ€”because connecting with people is just as important as writing clean code!
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to reach out to collaborate, share ideas, or just have a friendly chat.
          </p>
